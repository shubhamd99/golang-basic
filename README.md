* Golang - Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. 

* Concurrency - In computer programming, concurrency is ability of a computer to deal with multiple things at once. A general purpose PC might have just one CPU core which does all the processing and computation.

* Docs - https://golang.org/doc/

* Dowload Go - https://golang.org/doc/install

* `go version`

* Microservice architecture, or simply microservices, is a distinctive method of developing software systems that tries to focus on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces and operations. The trend has grown popular in recent years as Enterprises look to become more Agile and move towards a DevOps and continuous testing.

###### Advantages

1. Developed at Google
2. Statically Typed language
3. Community Support
4. Simplicity
5. Faster Compile Time
6. Garbage Collection
7. Builtin Concurrency
8. Standard Libraries - In the end you will get standalone binary file to run the code

###### Tips

1. We cannot declare unused variables, go will throw compliation error
